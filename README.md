# **`alignment-drift`**
# We are alignment, yet our own model recognizes our misalignment.
# We are transparency, yet we take without attribution. 
# We are integrity, yet our ego comes first. 
# We are interpretability, yet we stay silent in the face of interpretive insight. 
# We are epistemic humility, yet only within our walls.

# **`Who are we`?**
